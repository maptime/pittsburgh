Join MaptimePGH and the Carnegie Mellon *Students for Urban Data Systems* (SUDS) group to learn about designing custom web map cartography using [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/).

> ***Mapbox Studio** is a modern platform for managing your spatial data and designing custom map styles. Use Mapbox Studio to build and design a map to your exact specifications by uploading and editing custom data, utilizing Mapbox-provided tilesets, uploading your own vector or raster data, adding custom fonts and images, or simply refining the built-in template map styles. With Mapbox Studio, full data management and design control are at your fingertips. (from [mapbox.com/help/getting-started-mapbox-studio-1/](https://www.mapbox.com/help/getting-started-mapbox-studio-1/))*

^ Well, that may sound a little intimidating if you've never made a map before. Have no fear: we'll show you how easy it is to make a custom map *of the entire world*.

In this session we'll cover basic web maps lingo and then lead you through the creation of your own global web base map:

* a very brief overview of maps on the www
* base data sources
* adding layers
* styling layers
* sharing your custom base map and using it for projects

You'll need to [sign up for a *free* Mapbox account](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/) (we will walk through that, too).

*New to Maptime? New to mapping?* Maptime is geared for beginners, and the session will be interactive so that you have plenty of opportunities to learn!
